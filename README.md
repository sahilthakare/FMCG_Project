# 📊 AI-Powered QA System for FMCG Forecasting

This project is an open-source **AI-powered question answering system** designed to intelligently answer user queries using FMCG forecasting and operational data stored in Excel files. It combines classical information retrieval (TF-IDF + cosine similarity) with a lightweight open-source LLM to generate **human-like paragraph answers**, served through a simple **Streamlit interface**.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. FMCG_PROJECT/
  Main project directory.

b. Data/
  Contains the input Excel files:
    - Forcast.xlsx
    - Updated_Main_Data.xlsx

c. src/
  Contains source code modules:
    - __init__.py – Initializes the package
    - data_loader.py – Loads and cleans Excel data
    - vectorizer.py – Implements TF-IDF vectorization
    - retriever.py – Computes cosine similarity for retrieval
    - llm_answer.py – Generates paragraph-style answers using an open-source LLM
    - utils.py – Common preprocessing utilities

d. streamlit_app.py
  Main Streamlit UI for document upload and answering user queries.

e. requirements.txt
  Lists all required Python packages and dependencies.

f. README.md
  Provides an overview, setup instructions, and usage guide for the project.



Execution Flow:
1. Document Upload + Query Input  →  streamlit_app.py
2. Data Loading & Cleaning        →  src/data_loader.py
3. Vectorization                  →  src/vectorizer.py
4. Document Retrieval             →  src/retriever.py
5. LLM-based Answer Generation    →  src/llm_answer.py

Note : stewart.ipynb for practise
